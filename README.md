# Chess Openings API

An API currently containing **20 different chess openings** and is used in my other
project - [Chess Opening Browser](https://github.com/ognjen-simic/chess-openings-browser).

Every opening has the following information:

- Name
- Eco (e.g. C60)
- Starting move
- First few moves
- The type of opening
- A picture showing the opening
