# Chess Openings API

An API currently containing **20 different chess openings**, which i will use for my other
project - **Chess Opening Browser**.

Every opening has the following information:

- Name
- Eco (e.g. C60)
- Starting move
- First few moves
- The type of opening
- A picture showing the opening
